 * Resolves legacy docs.arbitrum.io URLs to pages on this site. Drives `pnpm redirects:legacy`.

 * destinations are rewritten to `/docs/...`.
 *
 * Two kinds of source feed in, and both flow through the same resolution order:
 *
 *  - **Upstream's own redirect sources**, read from the sibling repo's `vercel.json`. These are
 *    URLs upstream had already moved before the migration.
 *  - **Upstream's canonical page URLs**, derived from its `docs/` tree by
 *    `scripts/lib/upstream-pages.mjs`. These were never redirect sources anywhere, so nothing
 *    mapped them, and every one of them would have 404'd at cutover purely because of the `/docs`
 *    prefix. They are the larger half of the corpus.
 *
 * Only redirects whose destination provably exists in `content/docs` are emitted. Everything else
 * lands in the `.todo.json` worklist rather than being guessed at, because a redirect to a
 * merely-plausible page is worse than a 404: it silently sends readers somewhere wrong, and
 * `redirects:check` cannot catch it, because the destination exists.

/**
 * Resolve one legacy URL to a page on this site, declining rather than guessing.
 *
 * `source` is the inbound URL; `target` is where the reader was trying to land. For an upstream
 * redirect that is the end of upstream's own chain, and for a canonical upstream URL the two are
 * the same, because the page was live there. The order below is the whole policy:
 *
 *  1. `MANUAL_DESTINATIONS`: hand-verified, so it beats everything.
 *  2. Self-URL: the legacy path names a live page here under `/docs`. Serving our own copy beats
 *     following upstream anywhere else, and is the rule that resolves nearly every canonical URL.
 *  3. Section renames: whole sections that moved wholesale.
 *  4. Exact title: exactly one page here carries the upstream page's frontmatter title, verbatim.
 *     Ahead of the basename, because a title identifies a page and a basename only suggests one.
 *  5. Basename fallback: only when exactly one page here carries that slug *and* the basename was
 *     unique upstream too.
 *  6. `SECTION_LANDINGS`: the section the reader was heading for, for a page this site has not
 *     ported. Last, so it never masks a page that does exist here.
 *
 * Returns `{ destination, via }` or `{ reason, ... }`, where `reason` is the todo entry's reason.
