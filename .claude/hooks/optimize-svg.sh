# PostToolUse: optimize an edited SVG under public/img with svgo, in place.
# Non-blocking — any failure is swallowed so it never interrupts the workflow.
#
# INERT AS COMMITTED. Two things are missing and neither is supplied here:
#   1. This hook is registered in no settings file. There is no .claude/settings.json or
#      .claude/settings.local.json in this repo, so nothing ever invokes it.
#   2. `svgo` is not a dependency (see package.json), so the `[ -x "$svgo" ]` test below
#      fails even when the hook is invoked.
# It was salvaged from OffchainLabs/arbitrum-docs under FS-2702 for the config it applies
# (svgo.config.mjs, whose overrides carry the reasoning), not because it runs today. Wiring
# it up — adding the svgo devDependency and a PostToolUse entry in a settings file — is a
# deliberate follow-up. The path guard below was retargeted from the upstream `static/img`
# to this repo's `public/img` so that follow-up does not leave a hook that silently matches
# nothing. Optimize by hand meanwhile: `pnpm dlx svgo --config svgo.config.mjs <file>`.
