# Production readiness audit (FS-2677)

Date: 2026-09-17. Plan M-50, Wave 3.

## Summary verdict

**Not ready, but close.** Every one of the thirteen blocking gates passes, the build prerenders all 349
docs pages, `redirects:check` is green over 857 redirects, and 102 anchor fragments on the twenty
most-linked pages all resolve in the rendered HTML. Three things block a clean cutover: the home page
ships with no `<title>`, no meta description, no canonical and no social tags; eighteen docs pages hit a
React hydration failure from invalid HTML nesting; and Lighthouse performance is 80 to 84 on all three
sampled pages against the ticket's bar of 90.

## Environment

| Item              | Value                                                                                           |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Branch            | `fs-2677-readiness-audit`, head `606e174` (identical to `fork/main`)                            |
| Worktree          | `/Users/fionna/offchain/Fumadocs-wt/fs-2677-readiness-audit`                                    |
| Node              | v22.23.1, pnpm 10.29.3                                                                          |
| Upstream checkout | `/Users/fionna/offchain/arbitrum-docs`, HEAD `d0182a487` (declared freeze commit was `6a2738f`) |
| Server under test | local `pnpm build` then `npx next start -p 3136`                                                |

**Local, not a Vercel preview.** No preview deployment was available, so every check below ran against a
local production build. `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` was unset, so `getSiteUrl()` fell back to
`http://localhost:3000` and every absolute URL in the output (canonical, `og:image`, sitemap `<loc>`,
robots `Sitemap:`) carries that origin. The worktree is a full clone, so `hasFullGitHistory()` returned
true and last-modified dates rendered; a Vercel build at depth 10 will not. See "Checks that must be
repeated on a Vercel preview" for the full list.

## 1. Upstream drift and the post-freeze change list

`pnpm drift` exits 1 with **3 absent, 0 gutted**. All three are the post-freeze Priority Gas Auction
feature set, so the tree is at parity with the declared freeze commit `6a2738f` and behind `d0182a48`
only by that one feature.

```
upstream-drift: 3 absent, 0 gutted

  ABSENT  DRIFT  added 2026-09-03  how-arbitrum-works/priority-gas-auction/fast-feed.mdx
  ABSENT  DRIFT  added 2026-09-03  launch-arbitrum-chain/chain-config/sequencer/pga.mdx
  ABSENT  DRIFT  added 2026-09-01  how-arbitrum-works/priority-gas-auction/pga.md

upstream-drift: 5 allowlisted page(s) not reported.
```

The five allowlisted entries are the four pre-existing `guttedAllowlist` pairs plus
`node-running/sequencer-content-map.mdx`, none of them new.

The upstream working tree is dirty (untracked `stylus-by-example/` and `submodules/` directories). Drift
warns about this but the warning does not affect tracked-file comparison.

### What changed upstream between `6a2738f` and `d0182a48`

One merged feature branch stack (PRs #3559 "pga", #3563 "pga-setup-guidance", #3564 "fast-feed"), 582
insertions and no deletions across 16 files.

Glossary count: **159 entries here, 165 upstream**, the difference being exactly those six terms.

Note that drift reports only absent and gutted pages, so the two-line edit to the sequencer feed page is
invisible to it. A page ported at parity that later gains a paragraph upstream does not re-flag.

Nothing was ported. This is a report only.

## 2. `PendingWidget`

```
grep -rn PendingWidget --include='*.mdx' --include='*.tsx' --include='*.ts' . | grep -v node_modules
```

No matches. FS-2662 removed it and nothing reintroduced it.

## 3. Gate audit

### `ci.yml` structure

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` defines three jobs. Confirmed by reading the file:

- **`gates` (blocking).** No `continue-on-error` on the job or on any of its thirteen steps: `types:check`,
  `test`, `vars:check`, `nav:check`, `partials:check`, `node scripts/versioned-docs-check.mjs`,
  `references:check`, `faq:check`, `images:presence`, `check-links`, `contracts:check`, `format:check`,
  `content:lint`. All thirteen listed in CLAUDE.md are present and none is exempted.
- **`network-checks` (non-blocking).** One step, `precompiles:check`, carrying `continue-on-error: true`.
  The in-file comment states the reason: it fetches around thirty Solidity sources from
  `raw.githubusercontent` per run, so a GitHub outage reddens it for reasons unrelated to the change under
  review. Reaching zero findings would not promote it; losing the network dependency would.
- **`build` (non-blocking).** `continue-on-error: true` on the job. Runs `pnpm build` and then, against
  `next start` on localhost, `pnpm redirects:check` and `STATIC_DOCS_TEST_URL=... node --test
scripts/static-docs-http.test.mjs`. The comment records that the original reason for non-blocking status
  (remote image fetches at build time) is gone since FS-2681, so promotion is now possible and is
  deliberately deferred to its own change because a full build is the slowest job here.

The `Content debt` tier described in older notes no longer exists; `format:check` and `content:lint` moved
into `gates` on 2026-09-15.

Non-blocking: `precompiles:check` passes ("precompile tables: up to date"), `pnpm build` exits 0.

**The A7 exclusion is load-bearing.** `content:lint` is green only because `DEFAULT_RULES` filters out A7.
Running `node scripts/content-lint.mjs --rule=A7` reports three broken local images on
`content/docs/stylus/cli-tools/verify-contracts.mdx` (lines 177, 189, 199). Confirmed in the browser: those
three `<img>` elements have `naturalWidth === 0` and the network log shows three 404s. Already tracked as
**FS-2709**.

## 4. Build

`pnpm build` from a removed `.next`, exit 0.

No warnings or errors in the log.

**The docs route is now `● (SSG)`, not `ƒ (Dynamic)`.** FS-2698 landed, so 349 live docs pages plus three
archived-version paths prerender. The "Known trade-off (not a bug)" section of CLAUDE.md, which states that
docs pages are never prerendered and that `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` is load-bearing, is now
stale and describes the pre-FS-2698 world.

The 352 versus 349 difference is exactly the three archived paths, `/docs/run-a-node/start-here/v1`,
`/docs/run-a-node/run-batch-poster/v1` and `/docs/run-a-node/nitro/build-nitro-locally/v1`. All three serve 200. None of them has an OG image or a markdown mirror (`/og/...` and `/...v1.md` both 404), which is
tracked as **FS-2711**.

## 5. Lighthouse

Run with `npx lighthouse@latest`, `CHROME_PATH` pointed at the Playwright Chrome for Testing build
(`chromium-1228/chrome-mac-arm64/Google Chrome for Testing.app/...`), flags `--headless=new --no-sandbox
--disable-gpu`, categories performance, accessibility, best-practices, seo. The headless _shell_ was not
used; Lighthouse accepted the full Chrome for Testing binary. A fourth intended page,
`/docs/how-arbitrum-works/a-gentle-introduction`, does not exist on this site (404), so
`/docs/run-a-node/nitro/cli-flags-reference` and `/docs/stylus` were used instead.

| Page                                         | Performance | Accessibility | Best practices | SEO |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------- | -------------- | --- |
| `/`                                          | 81          | 96            | 100            | 83  |
| `/docs/stylus`                               | 84          | 98            | 100            | 100 |
| `/docs/run-a-node/nitro/cli-flags-reference` | 80          | 100           | 100            | 100 |

Metrics:

| Page                | FCP   | LCP   | TBT    | CLS   | Speed Index |
| ------------------- | ----- | ----- | ------ | ----- | ----------- |
| `/`                 | 1.2 s | 4.4 s | 220 ms | 0.002 | 1.6 s       |
| `/docs/stylus`      | 1.4 s | 3.9 s | 220 ms | 0.002 | 1.8 s       |
| cli-flags-reference | 1.7 s | 4.0 s | 290 ms | 0.002 | 1.7 s       |

**No page clears the ticket's bar of 90 on performance.** LCP is the dominant cost on all three, at 3.9 to
4.4 seconds. The three largest contributors are consistent across pages: around 345 KiB of unused
JavaScript (one chunk alone accounts for 190 KiB), 450 to 600 ms of render-blocking resources, and roughly
1.2 MB total page weight. Main-thread work and script bootup both score 1, so this is payload and
render-blocking, not execution.

These numbers come from a local server on a loaded developer machine and will differ on a Vercel edge
deployment serving prerendered HTML with a CDN. The measurement must be repeated on a preview before the
bar is judged met or missed.

Two scored defects worth their own note:

- `/` scores 83 on SEO because `document-title` and `meta-description` both fail. See item 10.
- `/docs/stylus` fails `heading-order` on `<h3 class="not-prose mb-1 text-sm font-medium">`, a card title
  rendered at h3 without an intervening h2.

## 6. Browser checks, light and dark

### Method

Playwright 1.56.1 from `~/.npm/_npx/d537ee5ee2a13f03/node_modules/playwright`, launched with
`executablePath` pointing at `chromium_headless_shell-1228`. One context per theme; dark set with
`context.addInitScript(() => localStorage.setItem('theme','dark'))` because next-themes defaults to light
and `colorScheme: 'dark'` does nothing. Navigation `waitUntil: 'networkidle'`, full-page screenshots at
1440x900.

### Page set

Section landings, derived from `content/docs/meta.json`'s top-level `pages` array plus the home page:
`/`, `/docs`, `/docs/get-started`, `/docs/build-decentralized-apps`, `/docs/stylus`,
`/docs/arbitrum-essentials`, `/docs/launch-arbitrum-chain`, `/docs/run-a-node`, `/docs/how-arbitrum-works`,
`/docs/arbitrum-bridge`, `/docs/notices`, `/docs/audit-reports`, `/docs/oracles`, `/docs/third-party-docs`,
`/docs/chain-info`, `/docs/glossary`, `/docs/contribute`. Seventeen pages.

The home page's own section cards were checked and add nothing outside that list; the rendered home page
links to twenty-three `/docs` URLs, all of which are either in the list above or deep pages.

Ten deep pages, seeded random pick. Seed `2677`, LCG `x = (x * 1103515245 + 12345) mod 2^31`, Fisher-Yates
shuffle over the sorted list of the 333 pages with at least three path segments after `/docs`:

1. `/docs/how-arbitrum-works/deep-dives/transaction-lifecycle`
2. `/docs/arbitrum-essentials/bridging/configure-token-gateway/standard`
3. `/docs/stylus/troubleshooting-building-stylus`
4. `/docs/third-party-docs/contribute`
5. `/docs/how-arbitrum-works/deep-dives`
6. `/docs/launch-arbitrum-chain/operate/ownership-access-control`
7. `/docs/stylus/how-tos/exporting-abi`
8. `/docs/third-party-docs/Reactive/reactive`
9. `/docs/build-decentralized-apps/quickstart-solidity-remix`
10. `/docs/arbitrum-essentials/arbitrum-vs-ethereum`

Fifty-four page-theme combinations. All returned HTTP 200. Screenshots are in the scratchpad at
`.../scratchpad/fs-2677/shots/`.

### Whole-site sweep

Because the 27-page sample found runtime errors, the check was widened to **all 350 routes** (349 docs
pages plus the home page), six pages in parallel, collecting `pageerror` and console errors, scanning
`main` innerText for `:::`, `[object Object]`, `<Var` and `{/*`, and flagging `img` elements with
`naturalWidth === 0`.

**Nineteen of 350 pages are defective.** Every one returns HTTP 200; the failures are client-side.

### Defect A: React hydration failure on 18 pages

```
Minified React error #418 (Hydration failed because the server rendered HTML didn't match the client)
```

Affected pages:

```
/docs/arbitrum-bridge/usdc-arbitrum-one
/docs/build-decentralized-apps/quickstart-solidity-remix
/docs/contribute
/docs/how-arbitrum-works/reference/arbos-reference
/docs/how-arbitrum-works/reference/geth
/docs/launch-arbitrum-chain/configuration/data-availability/das-docker-deployment
/docs/launch-arbitrum-chain/configuration/data-availability/data-availability-committees/deploy-das
/docs/launch-arbitrum-chain/configuration/data-availability/data-availability-committees/deploy-mirror-das
/docs/launch-arbitrum-chain/configuration/data-availability/data-availability-committees/get-started
/docs/run-a-node/arbos-releases/arbos40
/docs/run-a-node/arbos-releases/arbos51
/docs/run-a-node/nitro/build-nitro-locally
/docs/run-a-node/run-local-full-chain-simulation
/docs/run-a-node/run-nitro-dev-node
/docs/stylus/cli-tools/overview
/docs/stylus/reference/rust-sdk-guide
/docs/third-party-docs/Openfort/openfort
/docs/third-party-docs/Venly/venly
```

Root causes, established by rerunning the same pages against `next dev` on the same port to get the
unminified React message with its component stack. Three distinct causes, all invalid HTML nesting:

**A1. A link inside a heading, producing nested `<a>` (13 pages).** Fumadocs wraps heading content in its
own anchor, so a heading whose markdown already contains a link renders as an anchor inside an anchor.
From `/docs/third-party-docs/Venly/venly`, whose source line 10 is `## [Venly](https://venly.io/)`:

```html
<h2 id="venly" class="group/heading ...">
  <a data-card="" href="#venly"
    ><a href="https://venly.io/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Venly</a></a
  >
</h2>
```

The HTML parser cannot nest anchors, so it splits them and the client tree no longer matches the server
tree. Sixty-seven headings across twelve source files carry a markdown link, and
`/docs/build-decentralized-apps/quickstart-solidity-remix` adds a thirteenth case through a bare autolinked
URL in a heading (`1. Load Remix: https://remix.ethereum.org`).

content/docs/build-decentralized-apps/quickstart-solidity-remix.mdx
```

**A2. A raw `<p>` wrapping markdown that the pipeline wraps again (4 pages).** React reports `<p>` cannot be
a descendant of `<p>`. The four DAC and DAS pages each open with a hand-written `<p>` element containing
markdown prose, which remark then wraps in its own paragraph. Example,
`content/docs/launch-arbitrum-chain/configuration/data-availability/data-availability-committees/get-started.mdx:10`.
`content/docs/run-a-node/run-local-full-chain-simulation.mdx:21` has the same shape but is already counted
under A1.

**A3. A raw `<table>` whose rows are not in a `<tbody>` (1 page).** React reports `<tr>` cannot be a child of
`<table>`, and names `<table className="small-table">`.
`content/docs/arbitrum-bridge/usdc-arbitrum-one.mdx:17` opens a table and puts `<tr>` directly inside it;
the browser parser inserts the missing `<tbody>` and the trees diverge. The other three files with raw
tables (`run-a-node/troubleshooting.mdx`, `third-party-docs/LayerZero/layerzero.mdx`, the generated
precompile partials) all include `<tbody>` and none of them errors.

No gate catches any of the three. `types:check`, `check-links` and `content:lint` all pass on every one of
these pages.

### Defect B: three broken images

`/docs/stylus/cli-tools/verify-contracts` shows three `<img>` elements with `naturalWidth === 0` and three
404s in the network log, for `/img/stylus/standard-json-input.webp`, `/img/stylus/verification-success.webp`
and `/img/stylus/already-verified.webp`. This is the A7 finding above, already tracked as **FS-2709**.

### Defect C: a stale contribute guide

`/docs/contribute` renders the literal text `:::caution UNDER CONSTRUCTION` in its main content. This is a
false positive for the `:::` detector in the strict sense, because the text sits inside a fenced code
block. It is still a real content defect: the contribute guide instructs contributors to write Docusaurus
admonition syntax, which this site does not support and which `content:lint` rule A1 rejects. Source is
`content/partials/_contribute-docs-partial.mdx:204` and the two blocks that follow it.

### Defect D: wrong sidebar root label on eight pages

Eight docs URLs render a sidebar root switcher whose label names a section they do not belong to. Measured
by reading the `<aside>` root button text:

| URL                     | Switcher label shown | Correct |
| ----------------------- | -------------------- | ------- |
| `/docs`                 | Build apps           | no      |
| `/docs/chain-info`      | Third-party docs     | no      |
| `/docs/audit-reports`   | Third-party docs     | no      |
| `/docs/contribute`      | Third-party docs     | no      |
| `/docs/glossary`        | Build apps           | no      |
| `/docs/oracles`         | Build apps           | no      |
| `/docs/notices`         | Build apps           | no      |
| `/docs/arbitrum-bridge` | Build apps           | no      |

On `/docs/audit-reports` the switcher reads "Third-party docs" while the tree below it is the Get started
tree, which is visibly contradictory in the screenshot. The cause is structural: eight directories carry
`"root": true` in their `meta.json`, and these eight URLs sit outside all of them
(`content/docs/audit-reports.mdx`, `chain-info.mdx`, `contribute.mdx`, `glossary.mdx`, `index.mdx` are
top-level files, and `arbitrum-bridge/`, `notices/`, `oracles/` are directories with no root flag), so
Fumadocs falls back to an arbitrary root. `nav:check` passes.

### Defect E: sidebar titles

Hand-written `meta.json` titles that read wrong in the rendered sidebar:

- `content/docs/launch-arbitrum-chain/meta.json`: `"Launch arbitrum chain"`, lowercase brand name.
- `content/docs/stylus/cli-tools/meta.json`: `"Cli tools"`, should be "CLI tools".
- `content/docs/stylus/how-tos/meta.json`: `"How tos"`, should be "How-tos".

### Non-defects confirmed

- No page shows `[object Object]`, `<Var` or `{/*` in rendered content.
- No horizontal overflow on any of the seventeen landings at either 1440 px or 390 px.
- Light and dark themes both render correctly on every landing inspected. The announcement banner, hero,
  card grids, sidebar, table of contents and footer all invert cleanly. Screenshots read for `/`,
  `/docs/stylus`, `/docs/run-a-node`, `/docs/audit-reports` and `/docs/third-party-docs` in both themes.
- Dev mode also surfaces `Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop. Check the render method of
Header. It was passed a child from Layout.` on every page. React emits key warnings in development only,
  so this does not reach production users, but it is a real code defect somewhere in the navbar children
  passed through `lib/layout.shared.tsx`.

## 7. Anchors on the twenty most-linked pages

The link graph was built from all 349 `content/docs/**/*.mdx` files by counting `](/docs/...)` targets that
resolve to a real page, excluding self-links. Partials are not counted as sources of their own, but a
partial's links land in the including page and are counted there through the doc tree.

Top twenty targets by inbound link count:

| Inbound | Page                                                                                                  | Distinct fragments |

Every fragment used in a link to one of these pages was fetched from the running server and matched
against the `id` attributes in the rendered HTML.

**102 fragments checked, 0 missing.** The rendered HTML agrees with what `check-links` validates
statically. FS-2707 held.

## 8. `redirects:check`

`pnpm redirects:check` defaults to `http://localhost:3000` and fails against it, so the audit ran
`node scripts/redirects-check.mjs --base-url http://localhost:3136`.

```
redirects-check: 857 redirects against 349 routable pages (http://localhost:3136)

  21 external destination(s) not verified
  ok — every destination resolves, no source shadows a live page
```

Exit 0. The companion test in the same CI step also passes:
`STATIC_DOCS_TEST_URL=http://localhost:3136 node --test scripts/static-docs-http.test.mjs` reports 7 tests,
7 pass, 0 fail.

## 9. Legacy redirect spot check

`redirects.legacy.mjs` exports 853 entries. Ten were picked with a seeded shuffle (LCG seed `26772677`,
same generator as above) and followed with `curl -L --max-redirs 10`.

Docs pages are complete. Every OG image fetches as a real PNG.

**The home page carries no page metadata at all.** Its only `<meta name>` tags are `viewport` and
`next-size-adjust`. `app/layout.tsx` sets `metadataBase` and `icons` but no `title` or `description`, and
`app/(home)/page.tsx` exports no `metadata` object. CLAUDE.md records that `app/(home)/page.tsx` has no
canonical, which is deliberate, but the absence of a title and description is not the same decision and is
what drives the Lighthouse SEO score of 83.

**On `<time dateTime>`:** `source.config.ts` gates `lastModified` behind `hasFullGitHistory()`, which runs
`git rev-parse --is-shallow-repository` and returns true only for a full clone. This worktree is full, so
dates render. Vercel clones at depth 10, so on a preview or production build the field is `undefined`, the
"Last updated on ..." line disappears and the sitemap emits no `<lastmod>`, unless `VERCEL_DEEP_CLONE=true`
is set in the project's environment variables. The type never moves, because the guard picks between `true`
and a resolver returning `undefined`, both truthy.

## 11. Site-level endpoints

| URL                                 | Status | Content-Type    | Size      |
| ----------------------------------- | ------ | --------------- | --------- |
| `/sitemap.xml`                      | 200    | application/xml | 49464 B   |
| `/robots.txt`                       | 200    | text/plain      | 121 B     |
| `/llms.txt`                         | 200    | text/plain      | 69709 B   |
| `/llms-full.txt`                    | 200    | text/plain      | 4527732 B |
| `/.well-known/mcp/server-card.json` | 404    | text/html       | 82424 B   |

The MCP server card 404 is expected: **FS-2704** is in progress and has not landed.

`/sitemap.xml` holds 350 `<url>` entries (349 docs pages plus `/`) and 349 `<lastmod>` values, the home page
correctly having none. The three archived `v1` paths are absent, which is correct. Every `<loc>` reads
`http://localhost:3000/...` because `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` was unset at build.

`/robots.txt` emits the `Content-Signal: search=yes, ai-input=yes, ai-train=no` line and names the sitemap,
again at the localhost origin.

Other observations from the same sweep:

- `/docs/this-page-does-not-exist` returns 404 with an 82424-byte body, so the empty-bodied 404 described in
  FS-2688 no longer reproduces on a built site. That ticket is in progress and should confirm.
- Markdown negotiation works in both shapes: `/docs/stylus.md` and `Accept: text/markdown` on `/docs/stylus`
  both return 200 with `content-type: text/markdown`.
- Prerendered HTML carries `Cache-Control: s-maxage=31536000` and `x-nextjs-cache: HIT`. The negotiated
  markdown response carries the same `s-maxage` together with `vary: Accept`. The HTML response also lists
  `Accept` in its `Vary`. Whether Vercel's edge honours `Vary: Accept` as a cache key for this rewrite is
  the open question recorded in CLAUDE.md and in FS-2705 item 5, and it cannot be answered locally.

## Checks that must be repeated on a Vercel preview

Everything above ran against a local `next start`. These specific results do not transfer:

1. **Every absolute URL.** Canonicals, `og:image` URLs, `metadataBase`, sitemap `<loc>` and the robots
   `Sitemap:` line all read `http://localhost:3000` here. On a preview they come from
   `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`, and a production build with that variable unset is designed to throw. Confirm the
   throw fires and that the configured value is the real origin.
2. **Last-modified dates.** Absent on Vercel unless `VERCEL_DEEP_CLONE=true` is set. Verify the "Last updated
   on ..." line appears and that `<lastmod>` is present in the sitemap.
3. **Edge cache keying for markdown negotiation.** Confirm that requesting `/docs/<slug>` with
   `Accept: text/html` and then with `Accept: text/markdown` returns the right body each time through the
   CDN, and that a cached HTML response is never served to a markdown request. This is the one finding here
   that could silently corrupt responses in production.
4. **`Cache-Control` and `x-vercel-cache` on prerendered routes.** The `s-maxage=31536000` seen locally needs
   to be confirmed as an actual edge HIT, and the docs route's `private, no-cache, no-store` behaviour
   re-checked now that FS-2698 made the route static.
5. **Lighthouse.** Rerun all three pages against the preview. Local numbers include no CDN and a loaded
   developer machine, so the 80 to 84 performance scores are a floor, not the verdict.
6. **Request tracking.** `proxy.ts` only fires PostHog events when `VERCEL_ENV === 'production'`, so nothing
   was exercised locally. Verify `llms_file_fetched` arrives for `/llms.txt`, `/llms-full.txt`,
   `/docs/<slug>.md` and `Accept: text/markdown`, and that a revoked token would be logged rather than read
   as no traffic.
7. **Inkeep search and chat.** Every page logs `Inkeep API key is missing` three times here.
   `NEXT_PUBLIC_INKEEP_API_KEY` must be set on the project and the widget exercised. Fumadocs' own
   `/api/search` works without it and returns results, so search degrades rather than disappearing.
8. **`redirects:check` against the preview.** Not needed as a gate (CLAUDE.md explains why it must not move
   back onto a preview, since that requires `VERCEL_AUTOMATION_BYPASS_SECRET`), but one manual run against
   the preview origin confirms Next's `redirects()` behaves the same behind the edge.
9. **Node version.** `.node-version` pins the build to 22, but the Vercel project's Node.js Version setting
   is a separate control with no gate. Confirm it reads 22.x.

## Proposed tickets

Listed highest severity first. None was filed; the orchestrator files them.

### 1. Give the home page a title, description and social metadata

**Severity: high.** `/` ships with no `<title>`, no `meta description`, no canonical and no Open Graph or
Twitter tags. Confirmed by fetching `http://localhost:3136/` on a production build: the only `<meta name>`
tags present are `viewport` and `next-size-adjust`, and `grep -c '<title'` returns 0. `app/layout.tsx`
defines `metadata` with only `metadataBase` and `icons`, and `app/(home)/page.tsx` exports no `metadata`.
Lighthouse scores the home page 83 on SEO with `document-title` and `meta-description` both failing, while
every docs page scores 100. The site root is the page most likely to be shared and indexed. Not a duplicate
of any open ticket; FS-2668 completed social metadata for docs pages only.

### 2. Fix the invalid HTML nesting that breaks hydration on eighteen pages

**Severity: high.** Eighteen of 350 routes throw React error #418 (hydration failure) in a production build,
which makes React discard and re-render the affected subtree on the client. Reproduce by loading any page
in the list in section 6 with a console open. Three causes: a markdown or autolinked URL inside a heading
produces nested `<a>` (thirteen pages, sixty-seven headings across twelve files), a hand-written `<p>`
around markdown prose produces `<p>` inside `<p>` (four DAC and DAS pages), and a raw `<table>` with `<tr>`
children and no `<tbody>` (`content/docs/arbitrum-bridge/usdc-arbitrum-one.mdx:17`). No gate catches any of
them; `types:check`, `check-links` and `content:lint` all pass. The fix is editorial in the content plus a
new `content:lint` rule so the class stays fixed. Not a duplicate.

### 3. Raise Lighthouse performance to 90 on the three sampled pages

**Severity: medium.** Measured locally against a production build: `/` scores 81, `/docs/stylus` 84,
`/docs/run-a-node/nitro/cli-flags-reference` 80, against the M-50 bar of 90. LCP is 3.9 to 4.4 seconds on
all three and is the dominant cost; the three consistent contributors are about 345 KiB of unused
JavaScript (one chunk alone is 190 KiB), 450 to 600 ms of render-blocking resources, and roughly 1.2 MB
total page weight. Main-thread work and script bootup both score 1, so this is payload, not execution.
**Remeasure on a Vercel preview first**, because a local server has no CDN and these numbers are a floor.
Not a duplicate.

### 4. Give the eight rootless docs URLs a correct sidebar root

**Severity: medium.** `/docs`, `/docs/chain-info`, `/docs/audit-reports`, `/docs/contribute`,
`/docs/glossary`, `/docs/oracles`, `/docs/notices` and `/docs/arbitrum-bridge` all render a sidebar root
switcher naming a section they do not belong to, four of them reading "Third-party docs" and four reading
"Build apps". On `/docs/audit-reports` the label says "Third-party docs" while the tree below is the Get
started tree. Eight `meta.json` files carry `"root": true` and these eight URLs sit outside all of them, so
Fumadocs falls back to an arbitrary root. `nav:check` passes, so the fix should add a check as well as a
root assignment. Not a duplicate.

### 5. Fix three sidebar section titles

**Severity: low.** `content/docs/launch-arbitrum-chain/meta.json` reads `"Launch arbitrum chain"` with the
brand name lowercased, `content/docs/stylus/cli-tools/meta.json` reads `"Cli tools"` and
`content/docs/stylus/how-tos/meta.json` reads `"How tos"`. All three are visible in the rendered sidebar and
in the root switcher. Verified by reading the three files and by screenshotting `/docs/stylus`. Not a
duplicate.

### 6. Rewrite the admonition section of the contribute guide for Fumadocs

**Severity: low.** `/docs/contribute` still teaches contributors Docusaurus admonition syntax. Three code
blocks in `content/partials/_contribute-docs-partial.mdx` (from line 204) show `:::caution`, `:::info` and
friends as the way to write a banner, and the surrounding prose links to the Docusaurus admonitions docs.
That syntax does not render on this site and `content:lint` rule A1 rejects it, so the guide instructs
contributors to write something CI will refuse. Overlaps **FS-2708** ("Port the editorial style guide and
fix CONTRIBUTE.md's stale pointer"), which is in progress; fold this in there if the scope fits.

### 7. Remove the React key warning from the header

**Severity: low.** Every page in `next dev` logs `Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop. Check
the render method of Header. It was passed a child from Layout.` React only emits key warnings in
development, so production users are unaffected, but it is a genuine defect in the navbar children built by
`lib/layout.shared.tsx` and it adds noise that hides real warnings. Reproduce by loading any page under
`pnpm dev` with a console open. Not a duplicate.

### 8. Update CLAUDE.md's "Known trade-off" section, which FS-2698 made false

**Severity: low, documentation.** CLAUDE.md states that docs pages are never prerendered, that
`generateStaticParams` returns `[]` for zero output, and that `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` is
load-bearing. The build measured today prerenders 352 paths under `/docs/`, the route table shows
`● (SSG)`, and the prerender manifest lists 1057 routes. FS-2698 is Done. An agent reading the current text
would reintroduce the workaround. Not a duplicate; FS-2706 covers upstream decommissioning, not this.

### Already covered, no new ticket

- **Three broken Stylus verification images.** Confirmed in the browser (three `naturalWidth === 0`, three
  404s) and by `content-lint --rule=A7`. Exactly **FS-2709**, which also covers promoting A7 into the
  default rule set.
- **Archived version pages have no markdown mirror or OG image.** `/docs/run-a-node/start-here/v1.md` and
  `/og/docs/run-a-node/start-here/v1/image.png` both 404 while the page itself serves 200. **FS-2711**.
- **`/.well-known/mcp/server-card.json` 404s.** **FS-2704**.
- **`Vary: Accept` on HTML responses and shared-cache correctness.** **FS-2705** item 5.
- **Production environment variables** (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_INKEEP_API_KEY`,
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY`, `VERCEL_DEEP_CLONE`, Node 22.x project setting). **FS-2678**.
- **Porting the three PGA pages and six glossary terms.** A content decision for the freeze window, covered
  by the cutover runbook in **FS-2679**. Nothing was ported here.
